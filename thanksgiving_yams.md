Description
-----------

A recipe for Yams passed down from Annlee Naclerio to Joanna Naclerio. This is a staple at Naclerio family Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 lbs can of Yams
-   1 bag of mini Marshmallows
-   1 TSP Maple syrup
-   1/4 cup orange juice
-   butter

Directions
----------

1.  Drain and discard the juice from the yams
2.  Put yams in a large bowl and mash them.
3.  Add maple syrup, orange juice, and a few marshmallows, and stir them all together to combine.
4.  Put the mixture in a buttered baking dish, cover the whole surface with marshmallows, dot it with butter.
5.  Bake in a 350 oven for about 20-30 min., or until the marshmallows start to brown.
6.  Take out of the oven and let cool for a few minutes and serve.

Notes
-----

-   The consistency of the whole mixture should be like normal mashed potatoes, not too watery, nor too thick.
-   Not too much syrup because it may become too sweet.
