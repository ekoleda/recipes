Description
-----------

Good 'ol southern style biscuits. A little bit of Alabama in your life.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 cups all-purpose flour
-   2 tsp sugar
-   2 tsp baking powder
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/2 tsp baking soda
-   1/3 cup shortening
-   2/3 cup buttermilk (can substitute with 2% milk)

Directions
----------

1.  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda into a bowl.
2.  Cut in shortening. Blend until mixture looks like meal.
3.  Stir in almost all the milk (if dough is not pliable, add just enough to make a soft, puffy, easy-to-roll dough).
4.  Knead lightly 20-25 times.
5.  Roll out a little less than 1/2 inch thick. Cut with floured biscuit cutter (I just use a regular cup)
6.  Place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.

Notes
-----

-   Make sure to note that the measurements for dry stuff are teaspoons, not tablespoons. I mixed that up the first time, and the biscuits turned out ok, but def a little off.
-   Might be better if a little melted butter is used to glaze the tops.
