Description
-----------

Mom's famous Lasagna provided by Joanna Naclerio.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 lbs ground beef
-   1 can tomato sauce
-   1 can tomato paste
-   2 onions
-   No boil lasagna noodles
-   1 block Mozzarella cheese
-   1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
-   Thyme, Oregano, salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1.  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and beef to the pan, spreading it around the pan to break it up.
2.  When the meat has browned, add chopped onions.
3.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes.
4.  Add tomato sauce and paste, stirring to combine. Add spices.
5.  Reduce heat to simmer and mixture 5 minutes longer.
6.  Turn off heat and let cool a few minutes.
7.  Prepare casserole dish with non stick spray.
8.  Layer ingredients starting with meat sauce, then noodles then meat sauce, then cheese, etc.
9.  Last layer should be meat sauce and cheese. Save some extra cheese to add in the last ten minutes of baking.
10. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
11. Bake uncovered for 40 minutes. In last ten minutes add extra cheese.

Notes
-----

-   The noodles need to be wet to cook, so layer meat sauce around every layer.
-   I always run out of sauce for the top layer, so try to conserve as you're layering.
-   Mom usually only made this for special occasions because it was a lot of work. But we all loved it.
