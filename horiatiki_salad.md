A traditional Greek salad. In Greek this means, "the Villager Salad".

-   1 red onion
-   1 block of Feta cheese
-   Salt, Pepper, Olive Oil

Directions
----------

1.  Chop all ingredients and mix well together.

Notes

-   Traditionally this would be served with Greek Olives also, but since Eric doesn't like them we usually skip them.
-   We usually eat some warm Pita bread or Pita chips with this.
