Description
-----------

A pumpkin pie recipe utilizing a fresh, whole pumpkin. This recipe makes two normal sized pies, but it should be able to be scaled down for one pie. Borrowed from [pickyourown.org](http://www.pickyourown.org/pumpkinpie.php).

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 pie pumpkin or 3 cups cooked pumpkin
-   1 cup sugar
-   1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
-   1 tsp ground cloves
-   1 tsp ground allspice
-   1/2 tsp ground ginger
-   1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
-   1/2 tsp salt (optional)
-   4 large eggs
-   1.5 cans (12oz) evaporated milk
-   2 frozen pie crusts (usually 1 package)

Directions
----------

1.  Wash pumpkin, cut open, scoop out seeds and fibers.
2.  Steam pumpkin on stove, 20-30 minutes or until tender.
3.  Scoop out cooked pumpkin and discard skin.
4.  Puree the pumpkin with a blender until smooth.
5.  Mix all ingredients together in a bowl and pour into frozen pie crusts.
6.  Bake at 425 for the first 15 minutes, then turn the oven to 350 for the remaining 45-60 minutes. The pie is done when a knife can be removed cleanly.
7.  Let the pie cool before eating.

Notes
-----

-   Mixture will be very runny when pouring into the crusts, but it will firm up in the oven.
-   Depending on the size of the pie pumpkin, it may yield much more than 3 cups. The [Pumpkin Bread](/Pumpkin_Bread "wikilink") recipe can be a good way to use the extra.
