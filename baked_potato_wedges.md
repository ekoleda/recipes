Description
-----------

A recipe for homemade "fries" borrowed from the [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/baked-potato-wedges-recipe/index.html). They make a great side for [Bean Burgers](/Bean_Burgers "wikilink").

Ingredients
-----------

-   4 large potatoes, unpeeled
-   4 tablespoons good olive oil
-   salt
-   ground black pepper
-   garlic powder
-   paprika

Directions
----------

1.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2.  Scrub the potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, then cut each half in thirds lengthwise. You'll have 6 long wedges from each potato.
3.  Place the potatoes in a mixing bowl olive oil and spices. With clean hands, toss all the ingredients together, making sure the potatoes are covered with oil.
4.  Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet in a single layer with 1 cut-side down.
5.  Bake the potatoes for 30 to 35 minutes, turning to the other cut side after 20 minutes. Bake until they are lightly browned, crisp outside, and tender inside.
6.  Sprinkle with salt and serve.

Notes
-----

-   Feel free to experiment with other spices. Truffle oil can be used to fancy them up.
