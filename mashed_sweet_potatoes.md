Description
-----------

A recipe borrowed from [Martha Stewart](http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/mashed-sweet-potatoes).

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 - 3 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks
-   1/2 cup half-and-half
-   3 tbsp butter
-   2 tbsp brown sugar
-   salt and ground pepper

Directions
----------

1.  Set a steamer basket in a large saucepan. Fill with enough water to come just below basket, bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.
2.  Place sweet potatoes in steamer basket and cover; steam until tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
3.  In the same saucepan, bring half-and-half, butter, and brown sugar to a simmer, stirring to combine; remove from heat.
4.  Add in drained sweet potatoes, and mash just until smooth; season with salt and pepper.

Notes
-----

-   You can use milk instead of half-and-half.
