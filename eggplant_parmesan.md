Description
-----------

A delicious recipe for Eggplant Parmesan inspired by our CSA delivery of Eggplants, and some cobbling together of Rachel Ray, Martha Stewert and other recipes.

Ingredients
-----------

-   3-4 small eggplants peeled and sliced
-   2 eggs
-   3/4 cup breadcrumbs
-   1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
-   1 medium onion, chopped
-   2 cups tomato sauce
-   1 cup mozzarella cheese shredded
-   1/2 package no boil lasagna noodles
-   2 cloves garlic chopped

Directions
----------

1.  Peel and slice eggplant.
2.  Pre-heat oven to 375.
3.  In one bowl put 2 eggs and a little water. Whisk until thin.
4.  In a second bowl, mix parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs.
5.  Dip eggplant slices in egg wash, and then breadcrumbs. Place on a foiled baking sheet.
6.  Cook eggplant slices for 15-20 minutes on each side.
7.  While eggplant is cooking, saut√© garlic and onion, and shred mozzarella cheese.
8.  When eggplant is done, leave oven on and begin layering casserole dish. Sauce, lasagna noodles, sauce, eggplant, onions, cheese, repeat, ending with cheese on top.
9.  Bake in oven for 20 minutes. Take out and let rest for 5 minutes.

Notes
-----

-   Eggplant is best peeled with the red (cerated) peeler, not the smooth blade.
-   You can add any spices you like in the breadcrumbs bowl, or later in the layering stage.
-   The no boil lasagna noodles need to be surrounded by sauce (liquid) in order to cook properly.
