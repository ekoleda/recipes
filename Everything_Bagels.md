Description
-----------

This is a recipe I cobbled together for making everything bagels with a bread machine.

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 1/2 teaspoons of yeast
-   2 cups of bread flour
-   1 tablespoon of sugar
-   1 teaspoon of salt
-   3/4 cup of very warm water
-   1 egg, whites only
-   sesame seeds
-   poppy seeds
-   chopped garlic
-   salt

Directions
----------

1.  Place ingredients in the bread machine and select the dough cycle.
2.  When finished, remove the dough from the machine and split into six portions. Roll each portion into a ball, poke a hole in the middle, and spin around your finger until donut shaped.
3.  Boil a large pot of water while the dough is resting.
4.  Place bagels in the boiling water for 2 minutes, flipping after 1 minute.
5.  Remove from the water and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.
6.  Brush each bagel with egg whites and sprinkle with toppings. Flip the bagels and repeat for complete coverage.
7.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes until golden in color.

Notes
-----

-   Dried chopped garlic works well in place of fresh garlic.
-   The bagels don't rise very much in the oven, so larger bagels will be easier to slice when done.
