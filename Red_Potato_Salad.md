Description
-----------

Classic potato salad made with red potatoes for that extra bit of flavor.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 lbs red potatoes, cooked
-   1 tbsp dijon mustard
-   1 cup mayonnaise
-   1/2 cup sour cream
-   1 green bell pepper
-   1 onion
-   1 tbsp lemon-pepper seasoning

Directions
----------

1.  Cook potatoes with skins on in boiling salted water until just done (approximately 20-40 minutes depending on size of potatoes).
2.  Slice potatoes after they have cooled and place in mixing bowl.
3.  In a separate bowl mix all other ingreditents.
4.  Pour over potatoes and mix well.
5.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Notes
-----

-   It's very important to let the potatoes cool before cutting them. If they aren't fully cooled they will crumble apart and loose consistency.
-   Try adding boiled eggs to mayonnaise mixture to give it that eggy taste.
