Description
-----------

Mom's famous green bean casserole. This is how we used up the over abundance of green beans that came from our garden. It's a must!

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 large bowl green beans
-   1 can cream of mushroom soup (can substitute with Cream of Chicken Soup)
-   1 can crispy onion topping
-   1/4 onion, chopped
-   1/8 cup carrot, chopped

Directions
----------

1.  Clean and chop the beans. Remove ends and cut each bean into 2-3 pieces.
2.  Add chopped carrots and onion to beans, and steam until they are al dente. If you do not have a steamer tray you can quickly boil them.
3.  Put vegetables into a baking dish and pour the soup over.
4.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 35-45 minutes. About 5 minutes before you take it out, sprinkle the onion topping over caserole and place back in oven.

Notes
-----

-   The crunchy onion topping is optional, but in some ways the texture really makes the dish.
-   The Cream of Chicken soup is much better.
-   When you pour in the soup in step 3, make sure you mix very well.
