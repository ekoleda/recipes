Description
-----------

A greek dish that Christine enjoyed growing up, served along side [Patates Fournou](/Patates_Fournou "wikilink").

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 lbs green beans
-   1 cup water
-   1/2 cup olive oil
-   2 - 3 garlic cloves
-   1 onion
-   3 tbsp parsley
-   1 lbs tomatoes (2-3 big ones)
-   salt

Directions
----------

1.  Clean the beans by cutting the stringy edges all around with a sharp knife, rinse and drain them.
2.  Sautee the onion in the olive oil in a saucepan, add the tomatoes and the beans and sautee together for a few minutes.
3.  Add the water (the sauce should cover the beans) and bring to a boil. Add the parsley and the salt and stir.
4.  Cover and cook slowly for approximately 45 minutes. They should have a thick, oily sauce at the end.
