Description
-----------

A Greek Lentil Soup inspired by what Mom used to make and this [Simple Recipe](http://realgreekrecipes.blogspot.com/search/label/Soups).

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 lbs brown lentils
-   1 onion, chopped
-   4 cloves garlic, chopped
-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   2 bay leaves
-   1 pinch oregano
-   1/4 cup red wine vinegar
-   1 cup vegetable stock
-   salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1.  Rinse the lentils well in a colander under running water.
2.  Saut√© onion and garlic in pan with olive oil.
3.  Put lentils in the pan with the onion, garlic, and add bay leaves and oregano.
4.  Add enough water to cover everything plus another 1 or 2 cups.
5.  Bring to a boil and then simmer for at least 1 hour or until the lentils have become very tender.
6.  Once tender, add vinegar, salt and pepper and stir. Let cook for another 5 minutes to blend.

Notes
-----

-   If the water starts depleting too much, add more.
-   1 hour was a little too long. The lentils started to break apart.
-   Day 2, after refrigeration, it was even better!
