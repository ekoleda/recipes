-   3 tbsp flour
-   1 tbsp mustard
-   3 cups milk
-   1/2 cup onion, finely diced

Topping:

-   3 tbsp butter
-   1 cup bread crumbs

Directions
----------

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2.  In a large pot of boiling, salted water cook the pasta to al dente.
3.  While the pasta is cooking, in a separate pot, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour and mustard and keep it moving for about five minutes. Make sure it's free of lumps.
4.  Stir in the milk, onion, and paprika. Simmer for ten minutes.
5.  [Temper](/Techniques_Glossary#Temper "wikilink") in the egg. Stir in 3/4 of the cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
6.  Fold the macaroni into the mix and pour into a 2-quart casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese.
7.  Melt the butter in a saute pan and toss the bread crumbs to coat. Top the macaroni with the bread crumbs.
8.  Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and rest for five minutes before serving.

Notes
-----

-   The cheese mixture will still be very liquid when folded with the pasta, but it will solidify greatly in the oven.
