Description
-----------

A simple recipe for bean burgers, borrowed from the [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sandra-lee/black-bean-burgers-recipe/index.html). For a side, consider [Baked Potato Wedges](/Baked_Potato_Wedges "wikilink").

Ingredients
-----------

-   1/2 onion
-   3 cloves garlic
-   2 (15-ounce) cans beans
-   1 egg
-   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-   1/2 cup bread crumbs

Directions
----------

1.  In a food processor, pulse onion and garlic until finely chopped.
2.  Add 1 can of beans, egg, red pepper flakes and other spices. Pulse to combine.
3.  Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl, add the remaining can of beans and the bread crumbs. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and mix until well combined.
4.  Divide remaining mixture into 6 portions and form into patties. Place on hot oiled grill over medium-low heat and cook about 6 minutes a side or until heated through.

Notes
-----

-   We've tried black beans, pink bean, and kidney beans. They all work well.
-   You may want to add more breadcrumbs in order to get a firmer patty.
-   Avoid making them too thin, or else they will break apart while being flipped.
-   Mayonnaise is a good topping.
