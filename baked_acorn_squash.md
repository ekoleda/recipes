Description
-----------

A recipe I learned about from my former college roommate Matt. It is a great dish full of fall flavor. Has a taste somewhere in between pumpkin and yams.

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 acorn squash
-   1 tbsp butter
-   2 tbsp brown sugar
-   2 tsp maple syrup

Directions
----------

1.  Preheat oven to 400 F.
2.  Using a strong knife cut the acorn squash in half, lengthwise, from stem to end.
3.  Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and stringy stuff in the center of each half. Score the insides of each half several times with a sharp knife.
4.  Place each half in a baking pan, cut side up. Add about a 1/4 inch of water to the bottom of the baking pan so that the skins don't burn and the squash doesn't get dried out.
5.  Coat the inside of each half with 1/2 a Tbsp of butter. Add a dash of salt if you are using unsalted butter. Add a Tbsp of brown sugar to the cavity of each half. Dribble on a teaspoon of maple syrup to each half.
6.  Bake in the oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, until the squash is very soft and the tops are browned. Do not undercook. When finished, remove from oven and let cool a little before serving. Spoon flesh into a bowl and mash with a fork until the soft and well mixed.
