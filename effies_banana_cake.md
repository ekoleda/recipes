Description
-----------

Effie first made this cake for us in "the white house" when we visited for Mom's funeral. It made us all feel better for a few minutes. I got the recipe from Bellina, but there are a few translation problems. My comments in ().

Ingredients
-----------

-   3 cans concentrated milk (Sweetened Condensed Milk)
-   2 cups Creme Fresh from bakery (I used Heavy Cream)
-   Bisquick sugarless (Only had regular Bisquick at the store)
-   2/3 cup of milk
-   1 egg
-   2 TBSP sugar
-   3 chocolate bars
-   bananas
-   sweet liquor (I used Godiva Liquor)

Directions
----------

**Caremel Sauce**

1.  Boil 3 cans of concentrated milk for 2 hours. (I used a double boiler for this.)
2.  Stir every 5-10 minutes.

**Base of Cake**

1.  Pre-heat oven to 400.
2.  Combine 2 cups of Bisquick, milk, egg, and sugar in a bowl.
3.  Stir until smooth.
4.  Poor in large casserole dish and spread evenly.
5.  Cook for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.
6.  Test center with a knife or toothpick.
7.  Let cool and then spread a little liquor all over top of cake to soak in.

**Last steps**

1.  When milk finishes boiling, take off heat and let cool.
2.  Whip heavy cream until very thick.
3.  Mix heavy cream into milk a little at a time.
4.  Stir well.
5.  Pour milk mixture on top of cake.
6.  Refrigerate over night.
7.  Garnish with banana slices and shaved chocolate.

Notes
-----

-   Effie never specified how to boil the milk. Some internet searches revealed there are a number of methods, but I chose to go with this as it was the safest and most likely what Effie did.
-   Bellina had a hard time describing the cream. Her words were "Creme Fresh" but I believe she meant Fresh unpasteurized Cream from a baker. I wasn't able to find this, so I went with ultra-pasteurized Heavy Cream. This is harder to make thick, but it did the trick.
