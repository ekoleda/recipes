Description
-----------

A recipe for cheesy Broccoli passed down from Annlee Naclerio to Joanna Naclerio. This is a staple at Naclerio family Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Ingredients
-----------

-   5 Packages of frozen chopped Broccoli
-   1 lbs Velveeta cheese block
-   1 package of Ritz crackers crumbled
-   Butter

Directions
----------

1.  Add a little water to a large pot. Add frozen Broccoli and cook al dente.
2.  Add a slice of butter to a small sauce pan. Heat up.
3.  Cut up Velveeta cheese into small pieces, and slowly add to sauce pan. Keep heat very low. Stir often
4.  Add Broccoli to casserole dish. Mix in melted cheese, stir well.
5.  Sprinkle crumbled Ritz crackers on top. Dot with butter.
6.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes.
7.  Take out and let sit for 5-10 minutes.

Notes
-----

-   Make sure you get the "chopped" frozen Broccoli. Fresh is supposed to work as well, but Mom always used frozen.
-   Use an older sauce pan for the cheese melting. Some always burns to the pan.
-   Use the whole block of Velveeta even though it might seem like too much.
-   The recipe calls for 5 packages of Broccoli, but I used 4 and that seemed to be enough.
