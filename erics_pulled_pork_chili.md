Description
-----------

A chili recipe I put together for the 2006 Booz Allen Hamilton Chili Cook-off. This was my first time cooking chili, and it turned out really well. I got 6th place out of 8, with Bill the boss voting for my chili.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 lbs pulled pork
-   1 1/2 onion, chopped
-   1 Green bell pepper, chopped
-   1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
-   1 stalk celery, chopped
-   5 cloves garlic, chopped
-   2 (16 oz) cans diced tomatoes
-   2 (16 oz) cans red kidney beans
-   2 tsp ground cumin
-   4 tsp chili powder
-   1/2 cup Dinosaur BBQ barbeque sauce

Directions
----------

1.  Prepare [Crockpot Pulled Pork](/Crockpot_Pulled_Pork "wikilink"). Cut into small chunks and place into crockpot.
2.  Add pepper, onions, tomatoes, celery, and garlic. Cook on high for 4 hours, stirring occasionally.
3.  Add beans and cook for another hour.
4.  Add spices and sauce. Adjust amounts as desired.

Notes
-----

-   The longer it cooks the better it gets.
-   Add beans towards the end to avoid them getting mushy.
-   The resulting chili had good taste and texture, but could have used more spice. Consider adding spicy peppers to give it more of a kick.
