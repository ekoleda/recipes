Description
-----------

My Nana's recipe for Thanksgiving stuffing.

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 bag croutons (Arnold’s or Pepperage Farms)
-   1 roll sausage (Jones)
-   1 large onion, diced
-   5 Celery Hearts (stalks), diced
-   1 carton chicken broth
-   15 grinds of whole pepper 
-   1 generous pinch of Rosemary 
-   1 tbsp Bells seasoning (or more/less to taste) 

Directions
----------

1.  Pan fry Jones sausage roll into fine crumbles.
2.  Lightly sauté chopped onion and celery in a very large skillet, then add a little water.
3.  Place entire bag of croutons on top of sautéd onion and celery and add entire carton of chicken broth. (If consistency getting too wet, then hold off some liquid. But you will need most if not all of the carton.)
4.  Add sausage crumbles, spices and mix thoroughly.
5.  Put in large casserole dish and cover with foil.
6.  Bake @ 350 deg., preheated oven for approx. 30 minutes (if baking directly) or 45 minutes if coming from the refrigerator.
7.  Remove foil for the last 15 minutes of baking. (This allows any excess fluid to dry and the top to crisp just a bit.)

Notes
-----

-   Can be prepared the day before, holds up well in refrigerator.
