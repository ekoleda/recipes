A recipe borrowed from [FoodNetwork.com](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sunny-anderson/roasted-squash-toss-recipe/index.html) and adapted by Eric.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1/4 cup olive oil
-   2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon ground cumin
-   1 teaspoon red chili flakes
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1 (2 pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Directions
----------

1.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2.  In a large bowl, mix together garlic, olive oil, sugar, cumin, chili flakes and cinnamon.
3.  Add squash cubes and toss well to evenly coat. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
4.  Place on two sheet pans and bake until nicely caramelized and soft when poked with a fork, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Notes
-----

-   I reduced the amount of cumin and red pepper flakes to take the kick down a notch.
