Description
-----------

A casserole composed of various corn products. Has a texture kind of like a rich, moist corn bread.

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 can whole kernel corn, drained
-   1 can creamed corn
-   1 cup sour cream
-   1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
-   2 eggs
-   1/4 cup melted butter
-   1 package corn muffin mix

Directions
----------

1.  Combine all ingredients in a greased casserole dish.
2.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

Notes
-----

-   When mixing, first mix the wet ingredients and then add the corn muffin mix.
-   Bake in a large, flat dish rather than a taller one, otherwise the middle will remain moist and uncooked.
-   Broil for a minute at the end to ensure a crispy brown crust on the top.
