Description
-----------

Not sure where I got this recipe from.

Ingredients
-----------

-   4 lbs pork loin roast
-   6 apples
-   1/4 cup apple juice
-   3 tbsp brown sugar
-   1 tsp ground ginger

Directions
----------

1.  Rub roast with salt and pepper.
2.  Brown pork roast under broiler to remove excess fat; drain well.
3.  Core and quarter apples. Place apple quarters in bottom of crockpot. Place roast on top of apples.
4.  Combine apple juice, brown sugar, and ginger. Spoon over top surface of roast, moistening well.
5.  Cover and cook on Low 10-12 hours, until done.

Notes
-----

-   Apple cider can be used instead of apple juice.
-   The browning isn't required but might help lock in the juices or reduce fattiness.
