Description
-----------

Don't let the name scare you away, this is one dish you have to try\\! While not revolutionary, this dish is delicious and satisfying, perfect for the college student or a quick family dinner. A variety of condiments can be used, although syrup, suprisingly, is not recommended. Butter or margarine, ketchup, salsa, and barbeque sauce have all been tried with success.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 cups complete pancake mix
-   1 1/2 cups water
-   12 breaded chicken nuggets

Directions
----------

1.  Prepare pancake mix as directed on box, adding water and mixing well.
2.  Cook chicken nuggets as directed or desired.
3.  Chop each nugget into 4 small pieces and place in bowl.
4.  Heat greased skillet to medium-high heat.
5.  Pour in pancake mix to form average-sized pancakes.
6.  Right after pancakes are poured, place nugget pieces on top and press gently into the batter. Each pancake should get about 4-6 pieces of chicken nugget.
7.  When bubbles start to form on top of the pancakes, flip over and cook another 30 seconds.

Notes
-----

-   For this dish, simply microwaving the chicken nuggets is enough to cook them.
-   Re-grease the pan inbetween each batch of pancakes for optimal results.
-   This recipe yeilds 3-4 servings.
