Description
-----------

Inspired by a recipe on [SimplyRecipes](http://elise.com/recipes/archives/004316italian_pot_roast.php).

Ingredients
-----------

-   3 - 4 lbs rump or chuck beef roast
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/2 tsp ground black pepper
-   1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
-   1 carrot, diced (about 1 cup)
-   1 celery stalk, diced (about 1 cup)
-   1 red onion, diced (1 to 1 1/2 cups)
-   2 garlic cloves, finely minced
-   2 tbsp parsley
-   1 bay leaf
-   1 tbsp sage
-   3 cups red wine
-   1 can (28 ounce) italian plum tomatoes, put through a food mill to remove the seeds

Directions
----------

1.  Season the meat generously with the salt and pepper.
2.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, until the oil is hot, shimmering but not smoking.
3.  Add the roast and cook, turning it a few times, until it is nicely browned on all sides, 10-12 minutes. Transfer the meat to a platter.
4.  Reduce the heat to medium. Add the carrot, celery, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are golden brown and begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, 10-12 minutes.
5.  Add the garlic, parsley, and sage, and stir until the herbs are lightly colored and fragrant, about 1 minute.
6.  Add 1 cup of the wine and stir quickly, lifting up the richly browned caramelized vegetables that stick to the bottom of the pan. When the wine is almost all evaporated and thickly coats the vegetables, return the meat to the pan and turn it over a few times to coat it with the savory base.
7.  Raise the heat to high, adding the remaining wine, the bay leaf, and the tomatoes, and bring to a boil.
8.  Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, turning and basting the meat every half hour or so, until the meat is very tender and flakes away when pierced with a fork, 3-4 hours.
9.  Turn off the heat and let the roast sit in its juices for an hour.
10. Remove the meat from the pot and place it on a cutting board, covered loosely with aluminum foil. If the sauce is too thin, bring it to a fast boil and reduce it until it has a medium-thick consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning.
11. Cut the meat into thick slices (it will probably fall apart), and place on warm serving dishes. Spoon the sauce over the meat and serve hot. Serve with rice, mashed potatoes, or polenta.

Notes
-----

-   I left out the tomatoes, sage, and parsely the first time I cooked it, and it was still great.
